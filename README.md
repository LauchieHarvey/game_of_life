# game_of_life
Conway's Game Of Life implemented in pygame python 3.6

This implementation is the standard B3/S23 version (cell is born when it has three live neighbours,
survives if it has two or three live neighbours and dies otherwise.)
The game allows you to select the cells that are alive at any point by pausing.


Developing feature:
Adding a feature that shows a graph of the number of live cells over the number of generations once the user quits.
See `graphFeature` branch for the code for this feature.
