# John Conway's Game of Life
Implemented in pygame python 3.6
note-- this is no longer being worked on.

## What is it?
This implementation is the standard B3/S23 version (cell is born when it has three live neighbours,
survives if it has two or three live neighbours and dies otherwise.)
The game allows you to select the cells that are alive at any point by pausing.

When the user quits the main simulation they will see a graph of the number of live cells over the number of generations.
